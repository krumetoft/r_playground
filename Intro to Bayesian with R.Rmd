This is an intro to the Bayesian Statistics: From Concept to Data Analysis Notes Notebook.

As I always forget the odds definition, remember the die example:

A die has 1/6 / 5/5 = 1/5 odds to roll a '4'. Or P(A)/(1 - P(A)).

In terms of frameworks of probability, think of:
- Classical - outcomes are equally likely, but difficult when outcomes are not equally likely.
- Frequentists - hypothetical infinite sequence, relative frequency. If we lose 1/10000 router internet packages, the P(loss) = 1/10000
- Bayesian - Think Bayesian as personal perspective. Think of bet and at which odds you'd accept it.
  - Think of a fair coin, you win 3 if it's heads and lose 4 if it's tails. The expected value us 0.5*3 - 0.5*4 - in the long run, you'd lose 0.5 per play. 
  
If Chile is 756096 square km big and has 15 regions, think how big do you think region of Atacama to be? Assign probas to the below events
A1 - less than 10K ~ 0.1
A2 - 10K-50K ~ 0.2
A3 - 50K-100K ~ 0.45
A4 - 100K and more ~ 0.25
Rethink - Atacama is the fourth largest region.
Rethink again - The smallest region has an area of 15K squared kms.
A1 - less than 10K ~ 0
A2 - 10K-50K ~ 0.1
A3 - 50K-100K ~ 0.55
A4 - 100K and more ~ 0.35
Rethink again - the third largest ergion has an area of 108K squared kms.

A1 - less than 10K ~ 0
A2 - 10K-50K ~ 0.01
A3 - 50K-100K ~ 0.60
A4 - 100K and more ~ 0.39

Conditional probability - think of two events that are related.

P(A|B) = P(A and B)/P(B)

30 Students
9 females
12 CS Majors our of which 4 are females.

So, what is the P(F|CS) = P(F and CS)/P(CS) = 2/15/6/15 = 1/3 - Subsegment of the original probability.

Independence - one event does not depend on one another  P(A|B) = P(A), P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
